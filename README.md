# godot_interfaces
An example project of some ideas on how to implement interfaces in godot 4.x

Start the project, and the thing should fail sayint the Enemy node is not implementing the damagable interface, you can go ahead and uncomment the method and run it again and should not fail. 

## Possible improvement
[ ] Specify the script name 
[ ] Further define the Interface resource to specify the arguments and return types
[ ] Add argument types and return types.
